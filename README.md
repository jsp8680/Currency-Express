# Currency-Express

This website is live on Render

To put this website on Render you have to add environmental variables relevant to the database. Specifically the username and password. 
Render uses port 10000 so the port has to be an environment variable.

Using MongoDB requires you to add 0.0.0.0 to the network access so that Render can access the database.

0.0.0.0/0  (includes your current IP address) 

It should look like this.
